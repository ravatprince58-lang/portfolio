                I am a Front-End Developer and a second-year student who enjoys creating
                responsive and user-friendly websites. I have skills in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.

                As a fresher, I am always learning new things and improving my development skills through projects.
                I am looking for an opportunity to gain real-world experience and grow as a developer.
